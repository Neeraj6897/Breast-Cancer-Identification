# OnlineHackathon
This repository consists of a project which distinguishes the breast cancer tumour whether it is malignant or benign.

This dataset can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

The dataset is in the text format and we have used various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Regressor to train our and make the classification about the tumour.

FUTURE ASPECTS:
   In future this model can be improved using various advanced machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine(SVM) to improve the model accuracy.
